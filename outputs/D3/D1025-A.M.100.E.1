The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is preparing to remove Yellowstone's grizzly bears from the endangered species list later this year.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is poised to remove the park's renowned bears from the endangered species list.
200 or 250 grizzlies were in that region in 1975, when grizzly bears in the lower 48 states were listed under the Endangered Species Act.
If the administration goes ahead with taking Yellowstone's grizzlies off the list, it will become the 18th endangered species to recover under the Endangered Species Act.
