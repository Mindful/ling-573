China's State Environmental Protection Administration said here on Wednesday that the Songhua River in northeast China suffered a major water pollution incident owing to the explosion of a petrochemical plant at the upper reaches.
The Songhua River is a tributary of the Heilong River (called Amur River in Russia) on the border between the Russian far east and China.
The Nov. 13 blast in Jilin Jilin province, caused massive amounts of benzene to flow into the Songhua River.
The water supply has been cut off in Harbin northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, as the city's water source has been heavily polluted.
