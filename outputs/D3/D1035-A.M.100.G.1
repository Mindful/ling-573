Vietnam is launching a support fund for victims of the defoliant Agent Orange, more than two decades after its use by U.S. forces in the Vietnam War, the Labor newspaper reported Saturday.
They include former soldiers who fought in areas sprayed with Agent Orange by U.S. aircraft and children who were later born with deformities.
The birth defects, cancers and other illnesses that the Vietnamese attribute to Agent Orange can be caused by a wide range of factors, and Agent Orange may not be prominent among them.
