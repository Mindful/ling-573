Japan, where whale meat is part of culinary culture, reluctantly halted commercial whaling in line with a 1986 IWC moratorium.
Japan says it will seek approval to expand its catch at the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission opening on May 30 in South Korea.
Tokyo has applied to the International Whaling Commission for permission to nearly double its annual catch of Minke whales, currently set at 440, and to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union.
