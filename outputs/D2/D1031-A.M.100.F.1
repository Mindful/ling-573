They were located by helicopter and some were reached by boat and provided with supplies and medical treatment, coast guard director general arun kumar singh said thursday.
"many fish washed ashore, trees that were knocked down (smashed) into the reefs," michiru main who was a reef survey at mu ko surin thailand, when the tsunami struck, said in an e-mail.
