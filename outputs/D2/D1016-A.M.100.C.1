The government has launched an investigation into corruption under former president soeharto but has no plans to specifically target the former indonesian leader, attorney general soedjono c. atmonegoro told a packed news conference here yesterday. 	   
American magazine forbes estimated in july that soeharto, who stepped down amid mounting public pressure on may 21, had a fortune worth 4 billion u.s. dollars.
Local and foreign reports have accused soeharto of amassing wealth illegally during his 32-year reign and stashing the fortune overseas.
Local people and students in indonesia's capital held an anti-soeharto mass demonstration, starting at 14:00 local time on thursday.
