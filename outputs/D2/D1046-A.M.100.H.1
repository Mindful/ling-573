A boeing 747 plane carrying 50 tons of relief goods left guangzhou in south china for tsunami- stricken indonesia thursday, said an official of the ministry of commerce.
The first batch of 100-ton cargoes was airlifted to colombo sri lanka, wednesday morning.
The two batches of relief goods, worth 21.63 million yuan (2.62 ), are mainly tents, blankets, sheets and food that are badly needed by the people affected by the tsunami.
A chinese quake rescue team arrived in tsunami-ravaged indonesia early friday to help emergency aid efforts there.
