Australia strongly opposes japanese plans to expand its whaling catch in antarctic waters but will not try to board japanese whaling ships there because it could be accused of piracy, attorney general philip ruddock said saturday.
Opponents of the plan have claimed that japan is seeking to double to 800 the number of minke whales it will slaughter each year, and to add 50 humpback whales and 50 fin whales.
Japan, where whale meat is part of the traditional cuisine, reluctantly accepted a 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling by the international whaling commission .
