Opposition leaders on monday held lebanese and syrian governments responsible for the assassination of former prime minister rafik hariri, demanded syrian troops withdraw from lebanon within the next three months and called on the international community to intervene to help "this captive nation."
The explosion, apparently caused by a car bomb, occurred around 1:00 p.m. when hariri's motorcade of four black limousines escorted by jeeps was passing by in the seafront area of the capital.
Hariri  resigned last october.
Hariri had joined a chorus of objection to interference in lebanon's internal affairs.
