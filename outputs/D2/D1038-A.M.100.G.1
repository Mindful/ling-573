Us volcano mount st. helens roared to life friday, spewing a giant plume of steam and ash into the sky and raising fears of a new larger eruption.
Us geological survey scientists said the eruption at 11:57am (1857 gmt) marked a "small explosion" following a week of intensifying earthquakes in the area.
The eruption was nowhere near what happened 24 years ago, when 57 people were killed and towns 250 miles (402 kilometers)
The earthquakes quit after the eruption, said university of washington seismologist tony qamar.
