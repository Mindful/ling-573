Vietnam is launching a support fund for victims of the defoliant agent orange, more than two decades after its use by u.s. forces in the vietnam war, the labor newspaper reported saturday. 	   
According to u.s. records, the united states sprayed about 12 million gallons (45 ) of agent orange over parts of southern and central vietnam in 1961-71. 	   
It's virtually impossible to determine which birth defects or ailments are directly related to agent orange.
"you talk so much about human rights and humanity," said dr. le cao dai, who runs the agent orange program of the vietnamese red cross. "
