Ukrainian opposition leader and presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor said Saturday.
Zimpfer said that Yushchenko's dioxin levels have returned to normal and that he probably would leave the clinic Sunday or Monday.
Zimpfer said the doctors did not know for sure whether Yushchenko had been poisoned by just one substance or by a combination of substances.
Hospital director Michael Zimpfer said Yushchenko's blood contained more than 1,000 times the normal amount of dioxin.
Cases of dioxin poisoning are extremely rare.
Zimpfer said Yushchenko's skin nodules no longer indicated that disease.
