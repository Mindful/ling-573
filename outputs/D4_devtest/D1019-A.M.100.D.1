Six masked assailants have taken more than 20 people, including Americans and Europeans, hostage on a remote resort island in eastern Malaysia, police said Monday.
The hostages were said to have been taken onto a boat and are now at sea.
Muslim rebels in the Philippines who are seeking the release of militants jailed in the World Trade Center bombing case claimed responsibility Tuesday for the Malaysian kidnapping.
Philippine officials, however, expressed skepticism over the claim by the extremist Abu Sayyaf rebels.
Philippine officials initially said they were investigating possible links to the Abu Sayyaf.
