The Chesapeake Bay Foundation will file a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency Wednesday, signaling a more aggressive strategy for a group that has grown increasingly frustrated over the slow progress in cleaning up the bay.

With the nutria gone, the marsh is starting to look the way it did 70 years ago.
The whole effort will require millions more in funding and many more trappers.
