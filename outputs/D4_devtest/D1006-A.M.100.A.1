Merck officials said last week its latest research showed an increased risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular complications in patients who took Vioxx for at least 18 months.
Vioxx, Celebrex and Bextra are the only three drugs in a class known as Cox-2 inhibitors.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said similar prescription drugs were safe.
When Merck voluntarily withdrew Vioxx, FDA officials said heart problems were unique to that drug and that the mechanism underlying them wasn't known.
Long-term studies are not yet available on Bextra, approved in 2001.
