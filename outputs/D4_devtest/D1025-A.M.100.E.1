According to estimates at the time, there were between 150 and 220 Yellowstone grizzlies when they were placed on the endangered species list.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is preparing to remove Yellowstone's grizzly bears from the endangered species list later this year.
Grizzly bears in areas surrounding Yellowstone National Park would be removed from the endangered species list under a proposal to be announced next week.
200 or 250 grizzlies were in that region in 1975, when grizzly bears in the lower 48 states were listed under the Endangered Species Act.
