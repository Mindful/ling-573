Indonesian Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said here Monday that an investigation on the wealth of former government officials, including former President Soeharto and his family, was going on.
Soedjono said that he has assigned junior Attorney General to carry out the investigation.
Article four of the decree states that efforts to eradicate corruption, collusion and nepotism must be made indiscriminately upon any state officials, former state officials, their families and cronies as well as private businessmen, business tycoons and former president Soeharto.
The decree on clean governance included a stipulation that the government investigate Soeharto's wealth.
