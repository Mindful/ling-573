Groups of rare aboriginal tribes already near the edge of extinction in the Andaman and Nicobar islands survived a massive tsunami, the coast guard said Thursday.
Both areas were hard hit by the tsunami.
Others say that while the lack of mangrove forests probably exacerbated the destruction, it's unlikely that they would have slowed the tsunami's enormous volume of water.
At the same time, mangrove forests are teeming with life.
Mangroves grow in thickets along tropical coastlines and have tangled roots that grow above ground.
The agency reported one case in Thailand where the mangroves also damaged shallow coral reefs.
