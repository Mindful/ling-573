The defense on Monday demanded that the judge be changed for the court martial of Private Lynndie England, the US soldier seen in photographs from Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison holding a leash attached to the neck of a naked inmate.
Defense lawyer Rick Hernandez asked the military judge, Colonel James Pohl, to recuse himself because he had presided over all the other Abu Ghraib abuse cases.
The reduced charges carry a maximum sentence of 11 years.
Of the eight soldiers charged over the Abu Ghraib scandal, only Graner's case has gone to trial.
