Similar scenes are unfolding these days up and down the Chesapeake Bay, where the annual oyster season is becoming an endangered tradition.
Some oysters do survive in the bay.
By early next year, state and federal agencies expect to complete research on restoring the native oyster to the Chesapeake Bay.
Once the Chesapeake Bay's premiere species, native oysters have been virtually wiped out due to over-harvesting and disease.
Federal funding for oyster restoration efforts in Maryland and Virginia exceeded $4 million this year, organizers of Saturday's event said.
