Tropical storm Floyd strengthened Friday to become the fourth Atlantic hurricane this year, moving through the north Atlantic on a path that will take it north of the Caribbean islands and toward the eastern United States.
At 14:00 GMT, the center of the hurricane was about 330 kilometers east-northeast of Barbuda at latitude 19.1 north, longitude 58.9 west.
Hurricane-force winds extended about 105 miles from the storm's center, and tropical storm force winds extended another 175 miles.
Fema officials Monday said the agency has changed dramatically since then.
Floyd was on the verge of becoming a Category 5 storm.
