California has more threatened amphibians than any other state, according to Conservation International, accounting for 13 of the nation's 54.
The findings of more than 500 scientists were included in the first-ever global amphibian assessment, a three-year effort by researchers with IUCN-The World Conservation Union, the Center for Applied Biodiversity Science of Conservation International and NatureServe.
The survey found that 32 percent of amphibian species face extinction, compared to 12 percent of bird species and 23 percent of mammal species.
In New England, where native amphibian species aren't endangered, local declines are common.
