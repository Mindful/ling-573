The parents of Amadou Diallo plan to meet with the Bronx district attorney on Wednesday to receive a preview of the criminal charges that the grand jury voted to bring against the four New York City police officers who killed their son seven weeks ago.
The four officers fired 41 shots, hitting Diallo 19 times.
The four police officers have yet to officially explain their actions.
Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy pleaded innocent in a Bronx courtroom to second-degree murder.
Police officers have rarely been convicted for killings that occurred while they were on duty.
