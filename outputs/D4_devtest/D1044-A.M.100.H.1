Britain's Food Standards Agency on Friday issued an urgent warning advising people not to eat more than 350 food products inadvertently contaminated with an illegal dye.
Sudan 1 is a red dye used for coloring solvents, oils waxes, petrol and shoe polish and it is illegal to add it to food in Britain and the whole EU region.
Determined to find out how traces of the illegal dye Sudan 1 found its way into Britain's food chain, the FSA said it was conducting its largest ever investigation with the help of five local authorities.
