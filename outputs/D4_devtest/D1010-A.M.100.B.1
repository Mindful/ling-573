A 48-month-old cow that died recently has been confirmed as having had mad cow disease, making it the 14th case in Japan, the country's Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said Thursday.
The cow was born in Shikaoi, north Japan's Hokkaido region, in October 2000, and was checked for mad cow disease after it died.
The fatal brain-wasting disease is believed to come from eating beef products from cows struck with mad cow disease.
Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, eats holes in the brains of cattle.
The human form of mad cow disease is called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
