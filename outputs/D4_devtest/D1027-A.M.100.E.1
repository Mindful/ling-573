The trial for one of two men accused in the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard has been postponed.
Henderson and Aaron James McKinney, both 21, are charged with murder and face the death penalty if convicted.
Jury selection was to begin today, with opening statements scheduled for April 6.
Authorities said Henderson and McKinney posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar, kidnapped him, pistol-whipped him and stole $20.
The political science major at the University of Wyoming died five days later at a hospital.
