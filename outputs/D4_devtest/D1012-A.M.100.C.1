Flying at close quarters, air force officers reported that the aircraft's co-pilot appeared to have collapsed over his controls but no captain was visible through the cockpit window.
Oxygen masks were seen hanging in the cabin, a Greek government spokesman said.
After losing contact with the Athens airport's control tower, the Greek air force immediately sent two F-16 fighter jets to lead the airliner.
The Helios Airways flight ZU522 was headed from Larnaca, Cyprus, to Athens International Airport.
Oxygen masks dangled in the cabin.
The pilots also saw oxygen masks down when they got close to the aircraft.
