More than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other human factors, the World Conservation Union said Friday.
The IUCN plans to release a detailed report on the state of the world's coral reefs next month.
Besides human impact, coral reefs are also threatened by global weather change.
The study found as many as one-fifth of the world's coral reefs have been destroyed.
Coral reefs are among the oldest and most diverse forms of life.
