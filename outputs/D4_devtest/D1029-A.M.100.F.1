Thousands of troops moved into the region after a rocket barrage on the gas plant left eight people dead in January.
The clash erupted when a convoy of soldiers came under attack by armed men belonging to the Bugti tribe in the clan's stronghold of Dera Bugti, some 280 kilometers (175 miles) southeast of the provincial capital Quetta.
Dera Bugti lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Pakistan's main gas field at Sui.
Lasi said Sunday that about 5,000 Bugti tribesmen have taken up positions in mountains near Dera Bugti.
