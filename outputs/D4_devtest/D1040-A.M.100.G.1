His wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, was a woman with a reputation as a grifter and gold digger, who the defense contends trapped Blake into an unloving marriage by becoming pregnant with his child.
Closing arguments ended Friday with a plea from Blake's lawyer, Gerald Schwartzbach.
When that failed Blake tried repeatedly to solicit others to kill Bakley.
Ronald "Duffy" Hambleton, a former methamphetamine user, said Blake solicited him to kill his wife.
The prosecution case depended heavily on the testimony of two retired stuntmen who said that Blake solicited them to kill Bakley.
