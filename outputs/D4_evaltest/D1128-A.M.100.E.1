Taylor is seen as the single most powerful figure behind a series of civil wars in Liberia and neighbouring Sierra Leone between 1989 and 2003 which left some 400,000 people dead.
Taylor has pleaded innocent to 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity linked to the killing and mistreatment of thousands of people in Sierra Leone.
The former warlord-turned-president has been indicted by the United Nations- backed Special Court for Sierra Leone on charges of crimes against humanity, war crimes and violations of international human rights.
