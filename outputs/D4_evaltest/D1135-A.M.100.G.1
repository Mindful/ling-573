Madoff was arrested on Thursday for allegedly defrauding his customers through a giant pyramid scheme, with prosecutors alleging that the 70-year-old, a Wall Street veteran, confessed to losing at least 50 billion dollars.
The report said that Union Bancaire Privee, a major asset management institution specializing in hedge funds, could be exposed to the tune of one billion dollars.
The New York Times reported that a hedge fund advisory firm, Fairfield Greenwich Group, had invested 7.5 billion dollars with Madoff.
Fear ran deep for investors in Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC.
