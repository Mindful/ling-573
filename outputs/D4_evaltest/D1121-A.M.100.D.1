Nfl star Michael Vick pleaded not guilty to federal dogfighting charges on Thursday and was released without bond until a Nov. 26 trial.
Federal prosecutors allege the operation--known as Bad Newz Kennels--operated on Vick's property in rural Surry County.
The indictment alleges the fights offered purses as high as $26,000, and Vick once paid $23,000 to the owner of two pit bulls that had beaten Bad Newz Kennels dogs.
Vick and the two other co-defendants in his case also pleaded not guilty Thursday.
See, the trouble with pit bulls isn't the pit bulls.
Pit bulls are goober magnets.
