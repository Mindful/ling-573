Monsoon floods ravaging Bangladesh for more than a week have killed about 40 people and displaced or marooned millions, relief officials said Wednesday.
The ministry did not specify the number of flood-related deaths, but relief officials said at least 40 people died in the past week.
Flood situation therefore will deteriorate in about fifteen districts in northern, northeastern and central parts of the country.
Bangladesh is criss-crossed by a network of 230 rivers and suffers annual floods with at least a fifth of the country inundated each year.
