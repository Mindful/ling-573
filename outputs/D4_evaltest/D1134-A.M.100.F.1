Twenty-two women who took part in recent trials for a gel designed to prevent HIV infection during intercourse have contracted the virus, South Africa's health ministry said on Wednesday.
Researchers testing cellulose sulphate found that women who used the gel ran a higher risk of HIV infection compared with those who used a dummy lookalike, or placebo.
Last year, 2.8 million people in sub-Saharan Africa became infected with HIV, and 2.1 million people died.
In Geneva, the World Health Organization and UNAIDS welcomed publication of the trials in Kenya and Uganda.
