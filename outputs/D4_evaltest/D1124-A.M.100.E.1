A gas well operated by Lapindo Brantas Inc. has spewed steaming mud since May last year, submerging villages and forcing some 13,000 people to flee their homes.
A study by British experts said that the eruption was most likely caused by drilling for gas.
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has ordered Lapindo to pay 3.8 trillion rupiah (420 million dollars) in compensation and costs related to the mud flow.
An Indonesian minister, Aburizal Bakrie, claimed last month that the flow was a "natural disaster" unrelated to the drilling activities of Lapindo, which belongs to a group controlled by his family.
