Former American football star OJ Simpson was questioned by police in Las Vegas over an alleged armed robbery at a casino hotel room, police said Friday.
The alleged victim was identified by celebrity news website TMZ.com as Alfred Beardsley, a collector of sports memorabilia.
A lawyer for one of O.J. Simpson's co-defendants in an armed robbery case said Friday that his client will plead guilty Monday to a reduced charge and testify against Simpson and four others.
Charles Cashmore is accused of being one of five men who joined Simpson in a hotel-room confrontation with two sports memorabilia dealers.
