Most over-the-counter cold and cough medicines have been insufficiently tested in children, said Ganley, the director of the FDA's office of nonprescription drug products.
The American College of Chest Physicians last year recommended avoiding using cough and cold medicines in children, especially young ones.
Despite this recommendation, makers continued to sell cough and cold products labeled for infants.
Recent studies suggest that pediatric cough and cold medicines work no better than placebos.
Many cough and cold medicines now advise parents to "consult a physician" before use in such children.
