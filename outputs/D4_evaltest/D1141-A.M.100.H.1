Soil erosion affects up to 73,200 square kilometers of the land Guizhou--41 percent of its total land area--but around 25,000 square kilometers have been brought under control along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Pearl River in the past few years.
China is managing to reverse soil erosion in many areas.
By the end of 2005, the region has curbed soil erosion on more than 7,400 sq km of land.
The resettlements began in 2000 and have taken place more intensively since 2003.
Hotter, drier land is more vulnerable to soil erosion.
