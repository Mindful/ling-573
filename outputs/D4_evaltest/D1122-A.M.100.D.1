Pawlenty said the 40-year-old bridge was inspected by the Minnesota Department of Transportation in 2005 and 2006 and that no immediate structural problems were noted.
A school bus had just crossed the midsection of the bridge before it collapsed.
Several of the children were injured.
The entire span of Interstate 35W crumpled into the river below.
The steel-arched bridge, which was built in 1967, rose about 64 feet (19.5 meters) above the river and stretched about 1,900 feet (580 meters) across the water.
Some injured people were carried up the riverbank, while emergency workers tended to others on the ground.
