An Iraqi reporter threw his shoes at visiting U.S. President George W. Bush and called him a "dog" in Arabic during a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in Baghdad on Sunday.
President George W. Bush ducked a pair of shoes hurled at his head--one shoe after the other--in the middle of a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.
The incident occurred as Bush was appearing Sunday with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.
Nassar also said al-Zaidi had asked to cover the news conference, since he was the chief correspondent.
