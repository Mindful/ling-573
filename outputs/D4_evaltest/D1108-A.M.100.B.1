Cyclone Sidr, described as the worst storm in years to hit low-lying and disaster-prone Bangladesh, crashed into the southwestern coast Thursday night before sweeping north over the capital Dhaka.
The eye of cyclone Sidr, visible in satellite images as a colossal swirling white mass racing north from the Bay of Bengal, hit land in an impoverished coastal area near Bangladesh's border with India.
Disaster prone Bangladesh's worst cyclone disaster was in 1970, when some half a million people died.
Officials also travelled by speedboat to islands to warn residents to evacuate.
Chittagong airport and sea port were also closed.
