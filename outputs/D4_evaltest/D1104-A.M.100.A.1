Menu Foods, one of North America's largest suppliers of pet food, is recalling dog food sold throughout North America under 48 brands and cat food sold under 40 brands including Iams, Nutro and Eukanuba, a report by Canadian Press said.
Menu Foods said it has beefed up the testing of all raw materials and finished goods.
An unknown number of cats and dogs suffered kidney failure and about 10 died after eating the affected pet food, Menu Foods said in announcing the North American recall.
Menu Foods is majority owned by the Menu Foods Income Fund, based in Ontario, Canada.
