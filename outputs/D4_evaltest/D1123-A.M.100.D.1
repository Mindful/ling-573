Italian Foreign Minister Massimo d'Alema on Friday voiced his "strongest condemnation" of the rocket attack on the US embassy in Athens.
On Friday, the Greek authorities said they were investigating a claim that the rocket attack was also carried out by this extreme left-wing group.
November 17 itself fired a rocket against the US embassy in 1996.
In 2003, a special court gave multiple life sentences to November 17's leader, chief assassin and three other members.
November 17 carried out a similar rocket attack against the U.S. embassy in 1996, causing minor damage and no injuries.
