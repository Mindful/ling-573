Maruca-kovac said he phoned her at about 1 p.m. Wednesday, telling her he had left a note.
Maruca-kovac said Hawkins had recently broken up with a girlfriend and was fired from McDonald's.
Though he had his troubles, Hawkins was gentle and loved animals, Maruca-Kovac said.
Maruca-kovac said she found the handwritten note on the floor by his bed.
Hawkins lived with a friend's family.
The mother, Debra Maruca Kovac, said she found a suicide note after getting a phone call from Hawkins about 1 p.m., just minutes before the shootings.
