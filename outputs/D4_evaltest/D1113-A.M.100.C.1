Trading ivory was banned under the 1989 Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species to curb the slaughter of elephants in Africa.
Research they hope may help curb the illegal ivory trade.

South Africa, Namibia and Botswana all have booming elephant populations, while East African nations such as Kenya are struggling.
Without that cull, the population would have rocketed by now to 80,000.
