The military wing of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah movement claimed responsibility on Monday for a suicide bombing which ripped through a shopping mall in southern Israel town of Dimona.
A second suicide bomber was reportedly killed by Israeli police officers before he blew himself up in the mall.
Israeli security establishment is looking into the possibility that the suicide bombers who carried out the attack crossed into Israel through the Gaza-Egypt border.
A Palestinian suicide bomber detonated an explosive belt at a commercial center in Dimona on Monday morning, killing an Israeli woman and wounding at least eight others.
