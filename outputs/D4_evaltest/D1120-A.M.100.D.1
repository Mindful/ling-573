Global warming will worsen drought and reduce flows on the Colorado River, a key water source for several western states.
The most recent drought began in 2000 and has left the river's biggest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, roughly half empty.
In 1935, the Hoover Dam opened on the Colorado River, creating what is now Lake Mead.
Without the water, the wetland would dry up.
Both water managers and environmental groups see a broader picture in this debate.
Without some very wet years, federal water managers say Lake Mead may never completely refill.
